## EMMA

Hello, thanks for your interest in our work. We're the [EMMA team](https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/home/amazon-simbot-challenge), the Heriot-Watt University team that was one of the [finalists](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge/one) in the [Amazon Simbot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge), a university competition organised by Amazon to advance the state-of-the-art in Conversational Embodied AI. We created this Github organisation to organise all the code and artefacts that we are releasing to the public as part of our effort to create the first V+L model for Embodied AI tasks.

We're going to be at [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/) to present the paper [Multitask Multimodal Prompted Training for Interactive Embodied Task Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04067). We'll release everything soon! Follow the organisation for updates as we release things!
